!!! danger

    The vast majority of cryptocurrencies operate on a **public** blockchain, meaning that every transaction is public knowledge. This includes even most well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Transactions with these cryptocurrencies should not be considered private and will not protect your anonymity.

    Additionally, many if not most cryptocurrencies are scams. Invest carefully with only projects you trust.

## Monero

!!! recommendation

    **Monero** uses a blockchain with privacy-enhancing technologies that obfuscate transactions to achieve anonymity. Outside observers cannot decipher addresses trading Monero, transaction amounts, address balances, or transaction histories.
