Making payments online while retaining your privacy is a difficult challenge. The traditional banking infrastructure is intentionally designed in an anti-privacy manner to enable banks, other companies, and governments to easily trace transactions for a variety of purposes. Many people online view cryptocurrencies as the solution to this problem, but there are still a significant number of privacy concerns with existing cryptocurrencies.

This page outlines some payment methods and notable concerns with them, and is **not** recommending one method over others, or any at all necessarily. Making payments privately online is not a solved problem, and you should exercise extreme caution when doing so despite the claims being made by various payment providers.

## Cryptocurrency

!!! danger

    The vast majority of cryptocurrencies operate on a **public** blockchain, meaning that every transaction is public knowledge. This includes even most well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Transactions with these cryptocurrencies should not be considered private and will not protect your anonymity.

    Additionally, many if not most cryptocurrencies are scams. Make transactions carefully with only projects you trust.

### Monero

**Monero** uses a blockchain with privacy-enhancing technologies that obfuscate transactions to achieve anonymity. Outside observers cannot decipher addresses trading Monero, transaction amounts, address balances, or transaction histories. 

In 2020, [the IRS published a $625,000 bounty](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/09/14/irs-will-pay-up-to-625000-if-you-can-crack-monero-other-privacy-coins/?sh=2e9808a085cc) for breaking Monero's transaction anonymity. They ultimately [paid two companies](https://news.bitcoin.com/chainalysis-and-integra-win-1-25-million-irs-contract-to-break-monero/), Chainalysis and Integra Fec a combined $1.25 million for tools that purport to break Monero's private transaction scheme.

In August 2021, CipherTrace [announced](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ciphertrace-announces-enhanced-monero-tracing-160000275.html) enhanced Monero tracing capabilities for government agencies.

Due to the high price of CipherTrace's solution ($16,000/user/year to select government agents) and the unavailability of more information surrounding Chainalysis and/or Integra Fec's solution(s), none of these methods of tracing Monero have been independently confirmed. However, Monero's privacy features have been [called into question](https://web.archive.org/web/20180331203053/https://www.wired.com/story/monero-privacy/) by some security researchers, and a number of severe vulnerabilities have been found and patched in the past, so the claims made by these organizations are not out of the question.

Ultimately, Monero is the strongest contender for a privacy-friendly cryptocurrency, but its privacy claims have **not** been definitively proven one way or the other. More time and research is needed to assess whether Monero is resilient enough to attacks to provide adequate privacy to its users.
