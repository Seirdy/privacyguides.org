## Threat Models

==A threat model is a list of the most probable threats to your security/privacy endeavors.== Since it's impossible to protect yourself against **every** attack(er), you should focus on the **most probable** threats. In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your efforts to stay private and secure.

Focusing on the threats that matter to you narrows down your thinking about the protection you need, so you can choose the tools that are right for the job.


## Defining a threat

To make a threat model, we must first define a threat. A common mistake made by people who are just getting into the privacy space is to define the threat as "big-tech companies". There is a fundamental problem with this definition:

Why are we not trusting "big-tech companies", but then shifting our trust to "small-tech companies?" What happens if those "small-tech companies" turn out to be malicious? What happens when our favorite "small-tech company" becomes successful and grow exponentially? The proper way to define the threat here is the "service provider," not "big-tech."

Broadly speaking, there are four primary threats concerning an average person. You may be concerned with one, a few, or all of these possibilities, and the tools and services you use depends on what your goals are. You may also have specific threats outside of these categories as well, which is perfectly fine! The important part is developing an understanding of the benefits and shortfalls of the tools you choose to use, because virtually none of them will protect you from every threat imaginable.

- <span class="pg-red">:material-target-account: Targeted Attacks</span> - An adversary specifically targeting you to steal your data or persistently spy on you

Some of these threats may weigh more than others. For example, a software developer might have targeted attacks as their primary threat, but beyond that they would also want privacy from the websites they visit and so on. Likewise, an average Joe may have mass surveillance programs and service provider data access as their primary threat, but beyond that they also need to have decent security to prevent malware from stealing their data.

### Anonymity vs Privacy

Anonymity is often confused with privacy, but it's a distinct concept. While privacy is a set of choices you make about how your data is used and shared, anonymity is eliminating any trace of your identity on the internet.

Whistleblowers and journalists, for example, can have a much more extreme threat model requiring total anonymity. That's not only hiding what they do, what data they have, and not getting hacked, but also hiding who they are entirely. They will sacrifice any kind of convenience if it means protecting their anonymity, privacy, or security, as their lives could depend on it. Most regular people do not need to go so far.

### Privacy From Service Providers

We live in a world where almost everything is connected to the internet. Our "private" messages, emails, and social interactions are typically stored on a server somewhere. Generally, when you send someone a message, that message is then stored on a server, and when your friend wants to read the message, the server will show it to them.

The obvious problem with this is that the service provider (or a hacker who has compromised the server) can look into your "private" conversations whenever and however they want to, without you ever knowing. This applies to many common services like Discord, Telegram, SMS messages, and so on.

Thankfully, end-to-end encryption can alleviate this issue by encrypting communications between parties before they are even sent to the server. The confidentiality of their messages are guaranteed, so long as the service provider does not have access to the your private key.

??? note "Note on web-based encryption"

    In practice, the effectiveness of different end-to-end encryption implementations varies. Applications such as Signal run natively on the your system, and every copy of of the application is the same across different installations. If the service provider was to backdoor their applications to try and steal your private keys, that could be detected later using reverse engineering. 

    On the other hand, web based end-to-end encryption implementations such as ProtonMail's webmail or Bitwarden's web vault rely on the server dynamically serving Javascript code to the browser to handle cryptographic operations. A malicious server could target a specific person and send them malicious Javascript code to steal their encryption key, and it would be extremely hard for them to ever notice such a thing. Even if they do notice the attempt to steal their key, it would be incredibly hard to prove that it is the provider trying to do so, because the server can choose to serve different web clients to different people. 

    Therefore, to protect the confidentiality of your data from the service provider, you must use an end to end encryption implementation that does not rely on web clients.

Even with end-to-end encryption, service providers can still profile you based on **metadata**, which is not typically protected. While the service provider could not read your messages to see what you're saying, they can still observe things like who you're talking to, how often you message them, and what times you're typically active. Protection of metadata is fairly uncommon, and you should pay close attention to the technical documentation of the software you are using to see if there is any metadata reduction or protection at all, if that is a concern for you.

### Security and Privacy

Privacy cannot exist without a reasonable degree of security. Beyond not collecting sensitive data about a user, a piece of software must be secure enough to protect the user from potential adversaries. A common pitfall people often run into in their quest to strip any sort of telemetry data from their life, no matter how trivial, non-invasive or optional is that they sometimes end up with software with significantly worse security properties and cannot even protect them from basic attackers. When making a threat model, it is **extremely important** that you be rational about what type of data a piece of software collects, whether it is acceptable to you or not, and how secure is really is.

When it comes to application security, you generally do not (and sometimes cannot) know if the software that you use is malicious, or might one day become malicious. Even with the most trustworthy developers, there is generally no guarantee that their software does not have serious vulnerabilities that could later be exploited.

To minimize the potential damage that a malicious piece of software can do, you should employ security by compartmentalization. This could come in the form of using different computers for different jobs, using virtual machines groups of related applications, or using a secure operating system with a strong focus on application sandboxing and mandatory access control.

!!! tip

    Mobile operating systems are generally safer than desktop operating systems when it comes to application sandboxing. Apps cannot obtain root access and only have access to system resources which you grant them.

    Desktop operating systems generally lag behind on proper sandboxing. ChromeOS has similar sandboxing properties to Android, and macOS has app permission control and opt-in (for developers) sandboxing; however, these operating systems transmit hardware identifiers to their respective vendor. Traditional Linux desktop tends to not submit information to system vendors, but it has poor protection against exploits and malicious apps. This can be mitigated somewhat with specialized distributions which make heavy use of VMs or containers, such as QubesOS.

Targeted attacks against a specific person are more problematic to deal with. Common avenues of attack include sending malicious documents via emails, exploiting vulnerabilities in the browser and operating systems, and physical attacks. If this is a concern for you, you may have to employ more advanced threat mitigation strategies.

!!! tip

    **Web browsers**, **email clients**, and **office applications** all typically run untrusted code sent to you from third-parties by design. Running multiple virtual machines separating applications like these from your main system and each other is one technique you can use to avoid an exploit in these applications from gaining access to the rest of your system. Technologies like QubesOS or Microsoft Defender Application Guard on Windows provide convenient methods to seamlessly do this, for example.

If you are concerned about **physical attacks** you should use an operating system with a verified boot implementation, such as Android, iOS, macOS, or ChromeOS. You should also make sure that your drive is encrypted, and that the operating system uses a TPM or Secure Element for rate limiting attempts to enter the encryption passphrase. You should avoid sharing your computer with people you don't trust, because most desktop operating systems outside of ChromeOS do not encrypt data separately per-user.

### Mass Surveillance

Mass surveillance refers to organizations and sometimes governments working together to share people's data and track your activities across the internet. You can be tracked via a wide variety of methods, including but not limited to:

- Your IP address
- Browser cookies
- Data you submit to websites
- Your browser fingerprint
- Payment method correlation

Therefore your goals could be to segregate your online identities from each other, to blend in with other people, and simply to avoid giving out identifying information to anyone as much as possible.

Instead of relying on privacy policies (which are promises that could be violated), try to obfuscate your information in such a way that it is very difficult for different providers to correlate data with each other and build a profile on you. This could come in the form of using encryption tools like Cryptomator prior to uploading your data to cloud services, using prepaid cards or cryptocurrency to protect your credit/debit card information, using a VPN to hide your IP address from websites and services on the internet, etc. The privacy policy should only be relied upon as a last resort, when you have exhausted all of your option for true privacy and need to put complete trust in your service provider.

Bear in mind that companies can hide their ownership or or share your information with data brokers, even if they are not in the advertising business. Thus, it makes little sense to solely focus on the "ad-tech" industry as a threat in your threat model. Rather, it makes a lot more sense to protect yourself from service providers as a whole, and any kind of corporate surveillance threat that most people are concerned about will be thwarted along with the rest.

## Limiting Public Information

The best way to ensure your data is private is to simply not put it out there in the first place. Deleting information you can find about yourself online is one of the best first steps you can take to regain your privacy. Use email aliases, secondary phone numbers, and lie about your real information (name, birthday, "security" questions) whenever possible. If you have already submitted your real information to various different sites, employ disinformation and submitted various fake information related to the same online identity and make your real information indistinguishable from the fake one.

## Censorship Evasion

Censorship online can be carried out to varying degrees by actors including totalitarian governments, network administrators, and service providers seeking to control the speech of their users and the information they can access. While evading censorship, for the most part, is relative easy, hiding the fact that you are evading the censorship system can be very problematic.

The primary thing you must consider is what your adversary can observe on the network and whether there is plausible denialbility for what you doing. Take [encrypted DNS](basics/dns/#why-shouldnt-i-use-encrypted-dns) for example; while it can help bypass rudimentary censorship systems based solely on DNS, it cannot truly hide what you are visiting from your ISP. A VPN or Tor can help hide what you are visiting from the network administrators, but cannot hide that you are using those networks. Pluggable transports like Obfs4proxy, Meek or Shadowsocks can help you evade firewalls that block common VPN protocols or Tor, but an adversary can still figure out that you are actively trying to bypass their censorship system as opposed to just protecting your privacy through probing or deep packet inspection. 

When making a threat model, you must always consider the risks involved with trying to bypass censorship, what the potential consequences are, and how sophistcated your adversary may be. Be extra cautious with your software selection, and have a back up plan in case you are caught.

## Bad Practices

As a beginner, you may often fall into some bad practices while making a threat model. These include:

- Solely focusing on advertising networks instead of service providers as a whole
- Heavy reliance on privacy policies
- Blindly shifting trust from one service provider to another
- Heavy reliance on badness enumeration for privacy instead of systematically solving the problem
- Blindly trusting open source software

As discussed, focusing solely on advertising networks and relying solely on privacy policies does not make up a sensible threat model. When switching away from a service provider, try to determine what the root problem is and see if your new provider has any technical solution to the problem. For example, you may not like Google Drive as it means giving Google access to all of your data. The underlying problem here is the lack of end to end encryption, which you can solve by using an encryption tool like Cryptomator or by switching to a provider who provides it out of the box like ProtonDrive. Blindly switching from Google Drive to a provider who does not provide end to end encryption like the ecloud does not make sense.

[Badness enumeration](https://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/) cannot provide any privacy guarantee and should not be relied upon against real threat actors. While things like adblockers may help block the low hanging fruits that is common tracking domains, they are trivially bypassed by just using a new domain that is not on common blacklists, or [proxying](https://gist.github.com/paivaric/211ca15afd48c5686226f5f747539e8b) third party tracking code on the first part domain. Likewise, antivirus software may help you quickly detect common malware with known signatures, but they can never fully protect you from said threat.

Another thing to keep in mind is that open source software is not automatically private or secure. Malicious code can be sneaked into the package by the developer of the project, contributors, libary developers, or the person who compile the code. Beyond that, sometimes, a piece of open source software may have worse security properties than its proprietary counterpart. An example of this would be traditional Linux desktops lacking verified boot, system integrity protection, or a full system access control for apps when compared to macOS. When doing threat modeling, it is **vital** that you evaluate the privacy and security properties of each piece of software being used, rather than just blindly trusting it because it is open source.
